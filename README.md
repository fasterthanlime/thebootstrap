## What is the bootstrap?

The bootstrap is a support net for self-driven people in Switzerland.

To learn more about it, visit [http://thebootstrap.ch/](http://thebootstrap.ch/).

You can also read my long-winded post on the thought process behind it: [Hi, the world is yours!](https://github.com/nddrylliog/blog/blob/master/2012/thebootstrap.md#readme)

## I'm not in Switzerland, what's in it for me?

Not much so far. Since it's open-source software, you could just roll out your own instance.

However, I'd rather work directly with you and set you up with a subdomain for your own community: this way we don't get too fragmented.

Remember that the bootstrap exists to serve existing real-life communities, not to create online communities out of thin air.

If you're interested in a bootstrap subdomain for your own community, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/nddrylliog/thebootstrap/issues) or [drop me an e-mail](mailto:amos@official.fm)

## I want to get the software to run, where do I start?

Read INSTALL.md, it should get you started quickly.

Have fun!
