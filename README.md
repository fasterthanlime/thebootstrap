## What is the bootstrap?

The bootstrap is a support net for self-driven people in Switzerland.

To learn more about it, visit [http://thebootstrap.ch/](http://thebootstrap.ch/).

You can also read my long-winded post on the thought process behind it: [Hi, the world is yours!](https://github.com/nddrylliog/blog/blob/master/2012/thebootstrap.md#readme)

## I'm not in Switzerland, what's in it for me?

I, [@nddrylliog](https://twitter.com/nddrylliog), can only afford (time-wise) to operate and animate the swiss bootstrap.

However, if you want to start a similar thing in your local community, feel free to roll out your own install. I'll be happy to help!

## I want to manage my own instance, how do I get started?

Read INSTALL.md, it should get you started quickly.

Have fun!
